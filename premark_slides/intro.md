# Prerequisite Knowledge

1. Familiarity with statically-typed languages
2. Familiarity with dynamically-typed languages
3. Some very basic exposure to Python code

???

Basically, if you've used at least one statically-typed language and at least one dynamically-typed language, and you can read simple Python code well enough, you're all set.

Even if you haven't seen Python before, it's simple enough that you'll probably be fine.
